Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex system. It provides a unified
interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
Facade means the face of a building or particularly an outer lying interface of a complex system that consists of
several sub-systems

Identification:
Facade can be recognized in a class that has a simple interface, but delegates most of the work to other classes.

Sample Use Case:
Imagine we have a washing machine which can wash the clothes, rinse the clothes and spin the clothes but all the task
separately. As the whole system is quite complex, we need to abstract the complexities of the subsystems.
We need a system that can automate the whole task without the disturbance or interference of us.
